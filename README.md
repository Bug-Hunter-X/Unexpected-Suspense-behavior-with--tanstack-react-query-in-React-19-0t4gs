# React 19 and @tanstack/react-query Suspense Integration Bug

This repository demonstrates a potential issue when integrating the `Suspense` component from React 19 with the `@tanstack/react-query` library.

## Problem Description

When using Suspense with react-query, under certain conditions, the Suspense fallback UI may not be rendered correctly, resulting in unexpected delays or blank screens until the data is fetched. This can be especially problematic in larger applications. 

## Solution

The solution involves carefully handling the loading state and ensuring that the Suspense fallback is correctly displayed until all data from react-query is available.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Run the application: `npm start`
4. Observe the initial rendering behavior.  

## Note

This is a demonstration of a potential issue, and specific solutions may vary based on your implementation.
